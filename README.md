# Tab Harbor

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**A calmer Chrome new tab dashboard for open tabs, quick links, saved reads, and lightweight todos.**

Tab Harbor turns Chrome's new tab page into a place where you can keep working. You immediately see what is already open, which pages should be moved into read-later, and what still needs your attention.

## ✨ Core Highlights

- **Tabs are automatically organized by domain.** Tab Harbor groups open pages by domain, and moves homepage-style tabs into a dedicated `Homepages` group, so you can quickly see what you are actually working on.
- **You can still organize things around your own workflow.** When domain-based grouping is not enough, you can create manual groups, keep common quick links around, and jump back to the right section from the top icon rail.
- **Read later and todos move into the drawer, separate from the main workspace, without needing another app.** You can search, restore, or archive them later instead of leaving everything hanging in the browser tab bar.
- **It is not just a tab-cleaning tool.** Quick links, todos, open tabs, and saved reads all live in the same new tab page, so the next thing you need is usually right in front of you.
- **It tries to make the workspace calmer without making the system heavier.** You can switch themes, tune transparency, set a custom background, and clean duplicate tabs with one click, while everything still stays in `chrome.storage.local` with no backend or account.

### Unified tab management

Tab Harbor organizes tabs more like a workspace: **domain-based groups, manual groups, quick access links, and fast jumping from the top icon rail**. If you want to clean up the browser a bit more, you can **also remove duplicate tabs with one click**.

### Saved reads

Pages that are not for right now can be **moved into the side drawer, then searched, restored, or archived later**, instead of living forever in the browser tab bar.

### Todos and quick jumping

Tab Harbor also works as a tiny action layer: jot down todos, keep short descriptions, archive completed items, and jump back into the right group from the same page.

### Theme switching

When you want the page to feel more like your own workspace, you can **switch themes, tune transparency, and use a custom background image**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-warm-neutral.png" alt="warm neutral" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-soft-green.png" alt="soft green" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-soft-clay.png" alt="soft clay" width="100%"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/readme/theme-custom-background.png" alt="custom background" width="100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 🌊 Why It Feels Different

Most new tab pages try to be a search box, a wallpaper, or a speed dial. Tab Harbor is closer to a lightweight browser control room. It keeps the messy reality of browsing visible, but turns it into something calmer and more actionable.

That also means it is intentionally lightweight. There is no backend, no sync account, and no extra app to open. It lives exactly where the browsing chaos already happens.

## ⚡ Quick Use

### Install with a coding agent

1. Give your coding agent this repo:

   ```text
   https://github.com/V-IOLE-T/tab-harbor
   ```

2. Ask it to install the extension.
3. Open a new tab in Chrome.

### Install manually

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/V-IOLE-T/tab-harbor.git
   ```

2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Turn on **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the [`extension/`](extension/) folder
6. Open a new tab

## Custom Group Rules

If you want two related sites to appear as clearer separate groups, create `extension/config.local.js` and add personal rules there. A ready-to-copy example lives in [`extension/config.local.example.js`](extension/config.local.example.js).

For your DeepSeek case, this works well:

```js
globalThis.LOCAL_CUSTOM_GROUPS = [
  {
    hostname: 'platform.deepseek.com',
    groupKey: 'deepseek-platform',
    groupLabel: 'DeepSeek Platform',
    iconMode: 'label',
    iconLabel: 'DP',
  },
  {
    hostname: 'api-docs.deepseek.com',
    groupKey: 'deepseek-api-docs',
    groupLabel: 'DeepSeek API Docs',
    iconMode: 'label',
    iconLabel: 'API',
  },
];
```

`groupLabel` changes the visible group name, and `iconMode: 'label'` swaps the favicon for a text badge so similar logos are easier to distinguish in the top icon rail.

## 🔒 Fully Local

Tab Harbor runs entirely inside the extension. Open tabs come directly from Chrome, and saved reads, todos, quick links, theme preferences, and layout state stay on your machine through `chrome.storage.local`.

If you publish this repo for other people, they get the code and assets, not your personal browsing data.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

This is a Manifest V3 Chrome extension with a plain frontend stack and no build step required to use it. You can clone it, load it, and start using it without npm, without a dev server, and without standing up anything else.
